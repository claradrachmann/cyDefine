\arguments{
\item{reference}{Tibble of reference data (cells in rows, markers in columns)}

\item{markers}{Character vector of available markers present in both query
and reference.}

\item{using_pbmc}{Boolean indicating whether or not the Seurat PBMC atlas is
used as reference}

\item{initial_project}{Boolean indicating whether cyDefine should perform an
initial projection to remove redundant cell types of the reference. Set to
FALSE, if you want to keep all cell types of the reference. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{exclude_celltypes}{Only relevant if \code{using_pbmc = TRUE}. Character
vector of cell types of the Seurat PBMC reference to NOT consider during cell
type classification. Defaults to non-PBMCs.}

\item{celltype_col}{Column with celltype information.}

\item{min_f1}{Minimum F1 score required for two cell types to be separated}

\item{seed}{desc}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads. Use 0 for all available cores. Default is 2 if not set by options/environment variables (see below).}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables to possibly split at in each node. Default is the (rounded down) square root of the number variables. Alternatively, a single argument function returning an integer, given the number of independent variables.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity}
