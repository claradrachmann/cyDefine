# cyDefine 

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

`cyDefine` robustly identifies canonical cell types as well as unassigned (and potentially novel) cells in various single-cell cytometry datasets.

## Article

The manuscript for `cyDefine` is in preparation.

Please cite with `citation("cyDefine")`.


## Install from GitHub

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
# To ensure Rstudio looks up BioConductor packages run:
setRepositories(ind = 1:2)
# If you are correcting cytometry data, install the following Bioconductor packages:
BiocManager::install(c("flowCore", "Biobase", "sva"))
# Install cyCombine dependency
remotes::install_github("biosurf/cyCombine")

# Install cyDefine
remotes::install_github("claradrachmann/cyDefine", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Documentation

To view the documentation for using `cyDefine`, start R and enter:

```{r vignettes, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("cyDefine")
```

## Usage

Please see the vignettes for a detailed description of usage.

Here is a quick run-through of the main functionalities using example data.<br>
A large PBMC reference is also available, see `?pbmc_reference`.

```{r cyDefine, message=FALSE}
library(cyDefine)

# Run the cyDefine pipeline
classified <- cyDefine(
  reference = example_reference, 
  query = example_query, 
  markers = example_markers,                   # markers/features to use
  num.threads = 4,                             # Number of threads for parallelization
  mtry = floor(length(example_markers)/4),     # Number of markers to use in random forest classification
  num.trees = 500,                             # Number of trees to build in classification
  adapt_reference = TRUE,                      # Whether the reference should be adapted to the markers available in the query
  using_pbmc = FALSE,                          # Whether the PBMC reference is used
  batch_correct = TRUE,                        # Whether to integrate the reference and query using cyCombine (see ?cyCombine::batch_correct for more options)
  xdim = 6, ydim = 6,                          # Clustering dimensions for the integration
  identify_unassigned = TRUE,                  # Whether unassignable cells should be identified
  train_on_unassigned = FALSE,                 # Whether unassigned cells should be identified unsupervised or using unassigned cells in the reference
  seed = 332,
  verbose = TRUE
  )
reference <- classified$reference
classified_query <- classified$query


```

## Visualizations

cyDefine provides functionality for visualizing your results by UMAP, cell type abundance, and marker expression.
Additionally, you can create a chart of the merged cell populations during reference adaptation.

```{r diagram, eval=FALSE}
# Diagram of reference adaptation is only relevant if cell populations are merged (i.e., if "celltype_original" is created)
plot_diagram(reference, fontcolor_nodes = c("unassigned" = "white"))
```
```{r show_diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=6}
# Diagram of reference adaptation is only relevant if cell populations are merged (i.e., if "celltype_original" is created)
diagram <- plot_diagram(reference)
if (!is.null(diagram)) {
  vtree::grVizToPNG(diagram, width = 1200, height = 500)
  knitr::include_graphics("diagram.png")
}
```

```{r umap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}

# Define a color per cell type + black for unassigned
celltype_colors <- get_distinct_colors(unique(reference$celltype), 
                                       add_unassigned = TRUE)

# UMAP of reference and query
plot_umap(reference,
          classified_query,
          example_markers,
          sample_n = 5000,
          colors = celltype_colors)
```


```{r abundance, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 13}
# Barplot of cell type abundances in query
plot_abundance(predicted_populations = classified_query$predicted_celltype,
               colors = celltype_colors)
```


```{r heatmap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10}
# Heatmap of marker expressions per cell type in query
plot_heatmap(classified_query, 
             population_col = "predicted_celltype",
             markers_to_plot = example_markers)

```
