[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

`cyDefine` robustly identifies canonical cell types as well as unassigned (and potentially novel) cells in various single-cell cytometry datasets using reference-based phenotype transfer.
In short, `cyDefine` integrates a reference and query dataset, trains a random forest model on the reference, and applies it to the query data. Outliers and artifacts can then be identified based on unassigned cells in the reference (supervised) or from dissimilarity to predicted cell type (unsupervised).

## Article

The manuscript for `cyDefine` is in preparation.

Please cite with `citation("cyDefine")`.


## Install from GitHub

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
# To ensure Rstudio looks up BioConductor packages run:
setRepositories(ind = 1:2)
# If you are correcting cytometry data, install the following Bioconductor packages:
BiocManager::install(c("flowCore", "Biobase", "sva"))
# Install cyCombine dependency
remotes::install_github("biosurf/cyCombine")

# Install cyDefine
remotes::install_github("claradrachmann/cyDefine", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Documentation {#documentation}

To view the documentation for using `cyDefine`, start R and enter:

```{r vignettes, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("cyDefine")
```

## Usage

Please see the vignettes for a detailed description of usage.

Here is a quick run-through of the main functionalities using example data.<br>
A large PBMC reference is also available, see `?pbmc_reference`.

```{r cyDefine}
library(cyDefine)

# Run the cyDefine pipeline
classified <- cyDefine(
  reference = example_reference, 
  query = example_query, 
  markers = example_markers,                   # markers/features to use
  num.threads = 4,                             # Number of threads for parallelization
  mtry = floor(length(example_markers)/3),     # Number of markers to use in random forest classification
  num.trees = 500,                             # Number of trees to build in classification
  adapt_reference = TRUE,                      # Whether the reference should be adapted to the markers available in the query
  using_pbmc = FALSE,                          # Whether the PBMC reference is used
  batch_correct = TRUE,                        # Whether to integrate the reference and query using cyCombine (see ?cyCombine::batch_correct for more options)
  xdim = 6, ydim = 6,                          # Clustering dimensions for the integration
  exclude_redundant = TRUE,                    # Exclude reference cells not in the query
  identify_unassigned = TRUE,                  # Whether unassignable cells should be identified
  train_on_unassigned = FALSE,                 # Whether unassigned cells should be identified unsupervised or using unassigned cells in the reference
  seed = 332,
  verbose = TRUE
  )

```
`cyDefine()` returns three objects: 

```{r} 
names(classified)
```


## Visualizations

cyDefine provides several functionalities for visualizing your results. 
Here's a highlight of a UMAP and a heatmap of marker expression. 
See the [vignette](#documentation) for all plotting functions.


```{r umap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}

# Define a color per cell type + black for unassigned
celltype_colors <- get_distinct_colors(unique(classified$reference$celltype), 
                                       add_unassigned = TRUE)

# UMAP of reference and query
plot_umap(
  classified,
  example_markers,
  sample_n = 5000,
  colors = celltype_colors)
```


```{r heatmap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10}
# Heatmap of marker expressions per cell type in query
plot_heatmap(classified$query, 
             population_col = "predicted_celltype",
             markers_to_plot = example_markers)

```
